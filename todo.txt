=== Custom query


disallow thinglist selectall from selecting unselectablethings


- class handler: thing.def.stackLimit
Comp Handler thing.GetComp<T>.x
global dict for Make() getters?
enum  values
List Any/All
string handler
Def handler
handle arbitrary parents and list their fields (eg KindDef : Def)

type-in some text for next field
type-in . or tab to resolve that field


=== Fixes 

split DrawMain to DrawRow then DrawRight, so row.FinalX can be used to nudge DrawRight correctly in subclass overrides. 
 (Right now, any overrides to DrawMain might add things to the row after the parent class used row.FinalX)

fire graphic flickering in thinglist


===Mods to use TDFindLib

numbers

Stockpile filter details
Job target filter
colony manager automation



==more filters

mods?
Humanoid Alien Races

inventory: empty, any, % load - carrying vs gear vs apparel vs weapons

What other ThingQueryPreselectDef could we make.

hediff duration

Apparel required filter <ThingDef> pawn.apparel.ActiveRequirementsForReading.Any(r => r.RequiredForPawn(pawn, sel))



== more features

ctrl-C QuerySearch when locked
"sort by name" in library

Various ctrl-alt-f things.
ctrl-f select prisoner, ctrl-alt-f open prisoner search
Ctrl-F from info screen to match that thing. e.g. gene.



== New nice things

Result List => Multiplier per thing => total value? Nutrition and ___?
(e.g. Everybody gets one: until you have 10xNutrition, not just 10xfood)

sort by: closest to camera

Search caravans?
Search tradeships?

thinglist group by def large lists

All Maps filter by type : colony? raid? etc.



==QoL
  default all maps?.
  new and/or group flips its any/all from the container
Search available filters
search filter options (ctrl-f: pyro finds ThingQueryTrait option "pyro")

hover over filter, highlight things (eg show areas)
ctrl-f thinglist minimize option

floatmenu options by typing name
ThingViewer supports maps? Tab for each map?
thinglist tab/page down key to next thingdef
- dropdown to go to section by def.
- collapse same def

  save/load to file instead of clipboard?

restrict queries by list type - e.g. don't show 'personal details' like skills for item lists.

auto-optimize filter order based on current map: finding which filter narrows down most first.

user-editable refname directly when inactive and UsesRef.

Multi-window multi-search reorder(ie move/copy filter)

sort defs by something smart not just shortHash

remake ctrlf on map change? - harmony hook into notify

Fix ctrl-drag copying to work dropping on self:
transpiler to make reorderedAction happen always with ctrl-drag :
check (num != indexWithinGroup) OR this group handles ctrl-drop

zip copy/paste? System.IO.Compression



==Optimizations:
static constructor lists of options

proprocess queries by def



==Hardcore
Filter that references a query in the library.

Ctrl-f text input super smart:
- "mood" finds thoughts with mood
- "wood" finds harvest product: wood
- "weapon" finds equipped weapon subfilter
- "bionic" finds various references to bionic

ThingComp Filter
Reflection Filter: defined by def ?

flesh out baselist : ListerThings checkbox by def / category.

results stored in map -> def -> dictionary...
or literally another ListerThing?

options for how to Sort 

ctrl-f pin multiple thinglist+refresh



???
Get rid of Null options? Make it extraoptions.?
resolve references all the time so dangling references are cleaned? eg set up area filter and then delete area.
dragging thinglist window instead of unselect? Hard to tell difference between click and drag
